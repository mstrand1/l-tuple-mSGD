# CGM_ltuple

Welcome to the Github repository for Block Missing Data in Linear Systems: An Unbiased Stochastic Gradient Approach by Chelsea Huynh, Michael Strand, and Anna Ma. 

Here you can find the following:
- The $\ell$-tuple mSGD algorithm (MATLAB)
- Scripts to our synthetic and real world experiments/plots (MATLAB)
- Folder of raw CGM dataset separated by day and patient used in the real world experiments section our paper. Link to source data can be found [here](https://zenodo.org/record/5651217#.Y4VVL-zMJhE) 
- Script to trim the and align the raw CGM patient data (Python)
- Trimmed version of the dataset (csv files)
- Trimmed CGM patient data masking script (Python)
